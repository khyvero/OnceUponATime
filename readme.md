# Manifesto
Fairy tales are a form of literature that are known and read all over the world. Almost every child gets to hear fairy tales from fairy tale books. The most popular tales even get to be made into a film. But do you know any popular games that thematize a fairy tale? 
There are not many and especially not well-known ones of either board games or digital games. This genre seems to be pretty small and we think it should be extended further! 
One feature of fairy tales is that they always have a happy ending. In the context of a game, this feature would make fairy tale games perfect for children, as they like happy endings. Despite from that, fairy tales always show a kind of dreamy world of pure fantasy, where nature is beautiful, animals can talk and good and evil can be distinguished easily. These features would also make a perfect game genre for kids, but more importantly, we think that it would be a shame to not be able to dive into a beautiful world like a fairy tale world. Unlike other media like books or films, games can be experienced completely different, because the player can interact with them. That made us think: How beautiful would it be to just slip into the role of a fairy tale character and experience a pretty fairy tale with the own eyes? 
Fairy tale games could be a breakthrough in the way of telling fairy tales. Additionally, they could be an enjoyable experience, not only for kids, but also for adults who rewind their own childhood memories with this new medium.
 
This in mind, we got the idea to work on a game that would thematize the fairy tale of Rapunzel, which is a German fairy tale written by the Brothers Grimm and first published in 1812. This fairy tale got reinterpreted and made into a film called “Tangled” by Walt Disney in 2010. Our game should represent the original story of Rapunzel, with one big exception: There shall be no prince rescuing Rapunzel. We want the player to play as Rapunzel who flees out of the tower by herself. For those who now wonder what the fairy tale of Rapunzel actually is about, here comes a rough summary of it:
Once upon a time, there was a man and a woman who expected a child soon. The pregnant women constantly had appetite to eat a special herb named Rapunzel. Her husband always collected the herb for her, but the herb only grew in the garden of a witch. When the witch found out that she had been stolen from, she encountered the man and told him that she will let them continue to get the herb out of her garden, when she can have their child for herself as soon as it is born. When the child was born, the parents called it Rapunzel and handed it over to the witch. Ever since, the witch kept Rapunzel locked up in a tower, far away from civilisation. This is where our game story starts, but the original story continues with a prince visiting Rapunzel in her tower. As Rapunzel’s hair has never been cut, her hair is long enough to reach to the foot of the tower. That way, she can pull people up to the tower like an elevator. In the end, she will fall in love with the prince and he will rescue her from the witch.
The fairy tale takes place in a middle-aged European world and our game world should be adapted to that time. Still, as it is a fairy tale, we embedded some rather futuristic objects in the game, including working sanitary areas and not European fruit. 
In the story of our game, Rapunzel shall not know that the witch is not her real mother. She or rather the player should find out that the witch is not her mother and that she has a different family. In the beginning of our game, the player reads a diary entry that shows the thoughts Rapunzel had lately. It gives the player the hint to explore the surroundings inside of the tower in order to find out more about Rapunzel’s “Mother”. The text in the diary also suggests finding a way out of the tower. This gives the player an instruction of what to do and an idea of what the goal of the game is. After that, the player is free to explore the rooms by him/herself. Different keys which open locked doors or chests can be found, as well as clues, which get the story going. These clues can be any objects and when the player picks them up, Rapunzel will say something about it that gives some narrative context. Furthermore, important objects can be determined by a particle system that appears when picking them up. The goal of the game is to make Rapunzel find all the clues, so she realises that the witch who pretends to be her mother, is not really her mother.  This will give Rapunzel the reason to finally bust herself out of the tower. With the last clue, the player simultaneously finds the last key to get out of the tower and finish the game.
